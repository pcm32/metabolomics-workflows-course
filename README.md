# Metabolomics Workflows course - PhenoMeNal module

This is the material used for the 4th day of the [EMBL-EBI Metabolomics Workflows Course 2017](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/events/2017/metabolomics-workflows), held on November 2017 at EMBL-EBI. 

## Introduction to PhenoMeNal

Pablo Moreno (EBI) & Steffen Neumann (IPB-Halle)

## Hands on 1: Portal, public instance and deployment.

Portal hands on, to trigger a deployment and use the Galaxy instance deployed. Following [these instructions](portal-practical.md).

## Hands on 2: Build a workflow

You will be assigned to an instance previously deployed. We will first execute some tools one by one, and then build a workflow with them. The focus of the exercise is the mechanistic operation within Galaxy.

Login to your assigned instance.

### 2.1 Add data to your Galaxy instance

Follow [these instructions](add-data-fluxomics.md) for adding data to your account on the instance.

### 2.2 Run tools individually

Follow [these instructions](run-individual-tools.md) for running individual tools with the data.

### 2.3 Building a fluxomics workflow

Follow [these instructions](build-fluxomics-workflow.md) for workflow building inside the instance.

### 2.4 Running an existing fluxomics workflow

Follow [these instructions](https://portal.phenomenal-h2020.eu/help/fluxomics-workflow) for running the analysis with an existing workflow.
