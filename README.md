# Metabolomics Workflows course - PhenoMeNal module

## Introduction to PhenoMeNal

Pablo Moreno (EBI) & Steffen Neumann (IPB-Halle)

Slides (30 minutes)

## Hands on 1: Portal, public instance and deployment.

Portal hands on, to trigger a deployment and use the Galaxy instance deployed. Following [this instructions](portal-practical.md).

## Hands on 2: Build a workflow

You will be assigned to an instance previously deployed. We will first execute some tools one by one, and then build a workflow with them. The focus of the exercise is the mechanistic operation within Galaxy.

Login to your assigned instance.

Follow [this instructions](add-data-fluxomics.md) for adding data to your account on the instance.

Follow [this instructions](run-individual-tools.md) for running individual tools with the data.

Follow [this instructions](build-fluxomics-workflow.md) for workflow building inside the instance.

Follow [this instructions](run-existing-workflow.md) for running the analysis with an existing workflow.
